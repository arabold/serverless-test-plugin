#Serverless Test Plugin

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/serverless-test-plugin.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/serverless-test-plugin)

Simple _Integration Test Framework_ for [Serverless](http://www.serverless.com). This plugin is basically a
reimplementation of the `run` command, validating a function's _success_. You can test all
functions of your component by passing the `--all` option, and write the results into a 
JUnit compatible reports XML by specifying `--out <file-name>`.

This plugin is intended to run _besides_ your regular Unit Tests such as [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/), not as a replacement. It will solely validate that your functions have no compilation errors and can successfully run the provided `event.json`. At this point there's no output validation other than checking for success, failure or a timeout (that is, if your Lambda code exceeds the specified timeout value). 

Typically you want to run this plugin right before deploying your Lambda code.


The easiest example of running this plugin is

```
serverless function test --all
```

**Note:** Serverless *v0.5.0* or higher is required.


## Usage

### Configuration

This plugin can be configured on a function level by adding a `test` definition to the `custom`
section in your `s-function.json`.

Example:

```
"custom": {
  "test": {
    "skip": true
  }
}
```

Available options are

* `skip` - boolean; skip this function from all tests
* `event` - string; name of the event JSON definition; defaults to `event.json`


### Run Tests

Test an individual function:
```
serverless function test <function>
```


To test all functions in the current path, invoke the plugin without any function name:
```
serverless function test
```


To test all functions in the project specify the `--all` parameter:
```
serverless function test --all
```


You can also specify a stage and/or a region for your tests. If none is specified, the
first stage and region defined in your `_meta` folder will be used:
```
serverless function test <function> --stage dev --region us-east-1
```


To test all functions and output results into a JUnit compatible XML, specify the
`--out` parameter with a target file name:
```
serverless function test --all --out test_results/report.xml
```



Sometimes it is desirable to mock certain behavior in your code depending on whether it is running in a
test automation script or on an actual server. For this reason the `serverless-test-plugin`
introduces a dedicated environment variable `SERVERLESS_TEST`:

```
if (process.env.SERVERLESS_TEST) {
  console.log("This code runs as part of an integration test.");
}
else {
  console.log("This code does NOT run as part of an integration test..")
}
```
